# Minecraft Flight Plugin


## Description
The Minecraft Flight Plugin is a plugin designed for Minecraft version 1.20. It provides the ability to fly in the game using the `/fly` command and allows players to set their fly speed using the `/speed 1-10` command.


## Features
- Fly command: Use `/fly` to toggle flight mode. Once activated, you can freely move around in the air, exploring the Minecraft world from a different perspective.

- Speed command: Use the `/speed 1-10` command to adjust your fly speed. Replace `1-10` with a value to set your speed. Higher values make you fly faster, while lower values slow you down.

## Usage
1. Open the chat box and type `/fly` to enable or disable flight mode.
